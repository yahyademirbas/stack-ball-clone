# stack-ball-clone

This is a demo clone of Stack Ball 3D. This project based on only the core mechanic of that hypercasual game.
There are too many improvable parts in this version but... Does it worth for a clone game? The core mechanic has developed, rest is just fun.


*insert YOU ARE DIE joke here*
